# watchlistcalender
A personal movie or tvshow watched calender using python. 
Initially some random testing code. 
After a full functioning raw code my plan is to convert this hole project to a full responsive calender program. 
currently thinking about flask and django. Although I have to learn it. 
#####Questions I have now:
* How to i send this data to my google calender ? (maybe Google calender api!)
* Should i store those to a database or i just send them on the fly ? 
* From when to when I watched that episode and add those entry to my google calender event! (maybe i should use kodis default request parameter)

#####Currently my program can do:
* Retrive what is playing on my kodi and display them as playing {Serise Name} {Serise season} {Episode}
